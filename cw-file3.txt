We help new users to get started with e-Research, we provide the software that is needed, and if the software does not exist, we can fund developers to create it. We also help to guide the development of e-Research by liaising with national and international organisations, e-Research groups, standards' groups and - of course - the e-Researchers themselves.
We are funded by various groups, including the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Joint Information Systems Committee.
